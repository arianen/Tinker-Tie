# Tinker-Tie
A collection of files and sample code for the Tinker Tie Beta project. 
Tinker Tie is a Arduino-Compatible RGB LED bow tie!

All of the files in this repository are free for private use and tinkering noncommerically.
The example Arduino code is a modified version of the Adafruit NeoPixel library examples.
The assembly instructions guide is a rough draft, a nicer one is coming soon.
